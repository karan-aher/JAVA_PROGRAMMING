2. Install JDK:
    - Run the downloaded installer.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
    - Note the installation directory (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-<version>`).

3. Set Environment Variables:
    - Open the Start Menu and search for "Environment Variables".
    - Click on "Edit the system environment variables".
    - In the System Properties window, click on the "Environment Variables" button.
    - Under System Variables, click "New" and add a new variable:
      - Variable name: `JAVA_HOME`
      - Variable value: `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-<version>`
    - Find the `Path` variable in the System Variables list, select it, and click "Edit".
    - Click "New" and add the path to the JDK's `bin` directory (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-<version>\bin`).

4. Verify Installation:
    - Open Command Prompt.
    - Type `java -version` and press Enter. You should see the installed Java version.
